# Groupchat
A simplistic client-server chat application supporting text and voice communication written in Java for educational purposes. 
## Description
The focus of this project was to become more experienced working with threads and understanding network protocols better. My inspiration for the design and use of channels came from the VoIP applications Ventrilo and Teamspeak.
For the client-server connection and the text chat TLS sockets with self signed certificates are used. And for the transmission of voice UDP sockets were used.

A simple GUI for the client written in JavaFX is provided. For the capturing and playback of sound the javax.sound.sampled library is used.
This project was done using IntelliJ IDEA and Maven.
